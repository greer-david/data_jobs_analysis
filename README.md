- **Visual Studio Code**: My preferred code editor for querying and integration with GitHub.
## The Analysis

### 1. Premium Data & Business Analyst Positions

Identifying the highest-paying roles involved filtering data & business analyst positions based on average yearly salary and location.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    company_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    job_posted_date,
    salary_hour_avg,
    salary_year_avg,
    ROUND(COALESCE(salary_year_avg, salary_hour_avg * 2080)) new_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
WHERE
    job_title_short IN ('Data Analyst', 'Business Analyst')
    AND ROUND(COALESCE(salary_year_avg, salary_hour_avg * 2080)) IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    new_salary DESC
LIMIT 10
;
```
